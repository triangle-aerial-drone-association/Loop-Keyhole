# Loop-Keyhole

Access the script [here](Loop-Keyhole.py)

This script is the result of our experimentation to maximize the amount of points for the 2023 - 2024 REC Aerial Drone Competition Autonomous section. 

We attempted to loop both keyholes to get maximize our points but was only able to consistently loop one. Provided in this repository is the script we used and you can find a [video]{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMvdEAhZ2Zo} of it on Youtube.
